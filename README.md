<div style="text-align: justify">

In my previous roles, I was an architect and implemented DevSecOps, SRE, and Chaos Engineering strategies across a range of projects at different firms. Along with developing and overseeing numerous internal engineering projects, I have also established and led inner source communities within organisations and constructed APIs for R&D initiatives from conception to completion. 

In addition to actively participating in hackathons and innovation events, I also won grants and budgets for improving project features and supervised interns and junior engineers.

I'm currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Company Secretary from [Institute of Company Secretaries of India](https://www.icsi.edu) and am committed to continuous learning and personal development, leveraging OKRs as a guiding principle to accomplish objectives.
