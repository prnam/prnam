In my previous roles, I was an architect and implemented DevSecOps, SRE, and Chaos Engineering strategies across a range of projects at different firms. Along with developing and overseeing numerous internal engineering projects, I have also established and led inner source communities within organisations and constructed APIs for R&D initiatives from conception to completion. 

In addition to actively participating in hackathons and innovation events, I also won grants and budgets for improving project features and supervised interns and junior engineers.
